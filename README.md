Health & Welfare Enrollment Risk Prediction

## Business Context
Health & Welfare (HCO/H&W) operations support US employees during benefit
enrollments, elections, and life events. Missed enrollments lead to escalations,
manual corrections, and SLA breaches.

Due to confidentiality of real Health & Welfare data, this project uses an
enterprise HR dataset as a proxy to simulate enrollment behavior using
domain-driven assumptions.

## Objective
- Predict employees at high risk of missing benefit enrollment
- Enable proactive outreach by operations teams
- Reduce enrollment-related escalations and SLA violations
